# Sim_Python

The real world is full of systems, like airports and highways, that frequently experience congestion and delay. When these systems are not optimized, their inefficiency can lead to countless unhappy customers and hours of wasted time. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use Python’s simpy framework to create virtual simulations that will help you solve problems like these.

**In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:**

   * Use a simulation to model a real-world process
   * Create a step-by-step algorithm to approximate a complex system
   * Design and run a real-world simulation in Python with simpy

In this tutorial, you’ll create a simulation for a local movie theater. Your goal is to provide the manager with a script to help find the optimal number of employees to have on staff.
